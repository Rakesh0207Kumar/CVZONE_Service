# Volume Control via Hand Gestures

This project uses a webcam, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to control the system volume based on hand gestures. When the distance between the thumb and index finger exceeds a certain threshold, the system volume increases. Otherwise, the system volume decreases.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI
  
## Features

- Detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe.
- Uses the distance between thumb and index finger to control the system volume.
- Visualizes hand landmarks and gestures using OpenCV.

First, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rakesh0207Kumar/volume-control.git

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the required libraries. You can do this using pip:
