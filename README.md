This project uses computer vision to control the system volume using hand gestures. It leverages OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to detect hand movements and adjust the volume accordingly.

## Features

- Detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe.
- Uses the distance between thumb and index finger to control the system volume.
- Visualizes hand landmarks and gestures using OpenCV.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the required libraries. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
